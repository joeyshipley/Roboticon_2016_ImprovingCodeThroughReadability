# Roboticon 2016 - Improving Code Through Readability

### Further pursue this aspect of the craft

- Read: Clean Code - Uncle Bob
- Watch: Cleancoders.com: videos 1 to 5 - Uncle Bob (Full Disclosure: his videos are light hearted and a bit odd at times, but worth their weight in gold.)
- Read: Good naming is a process, not a single step - Arlo Belshee
- Read: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code - Martin Fowler

### Don't forget to try it yourself

- start your terminal, clone the repo, navigate to the folder
- run irb
- load './character.rb'
- c = Character.new
- c.dmg(:magic, 20, 0, false, nil)
- c.dmg(:shadow, 15, 6, true, nil)
- exit

### Code Touch Points

- magic values
- expressive names
- duplication
- design through functions
- comments
- expressive conditionals
- reducing complexity through removing conditionals
- func args
- touch back on naming and talk towards the 7 step process
